1.
Peak Height along low loss path. 
This is the 'maximum loss - minimum loss' along a low loss path. 

2. 
Hessian (k- largest eigenvalues) of 
This is the curvature normal to the low loss path. Essentially asking, are we in the grand-canyon 

3. 
Choice of path. How big is the curve. 

4. 
Peak height of convex combination between endpoints.


Maybe sample for 30 ish points per curve. 

Would be very nice with a plot as in Garipov.

Repeatability - maybe rerun experiments one or two more times with different seeds. 

Perhaps do Cifar100 first and then Cifar10.
